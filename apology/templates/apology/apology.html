        <p>We've come a long way, and I can't bear to lose you because you are really my person and I took that for granted. I didn't intentionally want to hurt you. I am literally in love with you. The possibility of you is better than reality of someone else. I want to make this work fr. Every day without you would feel empty, and Iâ€™m willing to give everything to rebuild what we had. ðŸ’–</p>
        <p>Would you be open to giving us one more chance? I promise you, Iâ€™ll do everything in my power to make you happy and not to hurt you. ðŸ’•</p>
